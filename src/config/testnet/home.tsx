          <p>This is a gateway to access LeapDAO Testnet chain.</p>
          <p>The chain runs <b>The Raft</b> version of the LeapDAO chain software:</p>
          <ul style={{ marginInlineStart: '1.5em' }}>
            <li>PoA network based on Tendermint BFT. Nodes are operated by LeapDAO</li>
            <li>ability to transfer ERC20/ERC721 tokens</li>
            <li>secured by partial <a href="https://www.learnplasma.org/en/learn/mvp.html#more-viable-plasma">MoreVP Plasma</a> implementation running on Rinkeby network</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>The Raft</b> is the first step of the LeapDAO\'s roadmap to eventually run a public Plasma network governed by DAO and supporting provable computations. You can read more about our development proposition here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vStTjqvqZGyiI5AVtpwCIMlHFnzC_4bbixsCfs27-M8/edit">Plasma Leap whitepaper</a></p>
          <h1>Next steps</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>As a user</strong>, you can try out the network:
          </p>
          <ol style={{ marginInlineStart: '1.5em' }}>
            {CONFIG.tokenFaucet && (<li><a href="/faucet">Get</a> some LEAP tokens on Rinkeby</li>)}
            <li><a href="">Deposit</a> them to the chain. Your root chain coins will be locked in Plasma contract and you will get an equivalent in plasma-tokens on a Leap network.</li>
            <li><a href="">Transfer around</a> your coins. Transfers will happen on the Leap Network, free and fast. You can also try out our <a href="">mobile wallet alpha</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Exit</a> your coins back to the root chain.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            <strong>As a dapp developer</strong>, you can <a href="">request</a> your token to be registered on the network. You can use our APIs in your dapp to transact on Leap network (only ERC20/ERC721 transfers are supported so far).
